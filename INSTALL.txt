INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

== PYTHON ==
Install Python 3.X (32-bit) from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
For example for Windows: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.2/python-3.6.2.exe

== PACKAGES ==
At the time this file is written there is no "official" python version of openCV for Python 3
Instead used custom built wheels available on this website: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

Choose packages 
To install a package, download the corresponding *.whl file and run the following in a console (with elevated rights, etc.)
>> pip install "*.whl"
Be sure to use the file corresponding to your version of python and your OS
For example for Python 3.6 and Windows 32-bit, there should be *cp36*win32* in the name

To be sure everything goes smoothly, stick to these version files for now (they tend to be interdependent)
And install them in the following order
- Numpy, numpy-1.13.1+mkl-cp36-cp36m-win32.whl, http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy
- OpenCV, opencv_python-3.3.0-cp36-cp36m-win32.whl, http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv
- Scipy, scipy-0.19.1-cp36-cp36m-win32.whl, http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy
- Matplotlib, matplotlib-2.1.0rc1-cp36-cp36m-win32.whl, http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#matplotlib

== IDE ==
A ligth python IDE is Spyder
You can install it directly by running
>> pip install --upgrade spyder

You might want to install/upgrade PyQT5, since it seems it won't do it by itself (even though dependencies should be installed automatically) and that can lead to annoying warnings/errors when using Spyder
>> pip install --upgrade pyqt5

The executable is located in the $PYTHON$/Scripts directory
For example: â€ªC:\Python36-32\Scripts\spyder3.exe
